# Learn_Python for Data Science

Welcome to my repository created as I my learning Python. I started as a complete beginner to the Python world and progressed towards learning Python the way which is supposed to be learnt (i.e is by making mistakes). Here in the repository I am creating Jupyter notebooks which I used to learn Python and will also attempt where a novice Python learner would make mistakes. 

I would keep the mistake as it is in the file for the sake of understanding. Hope this attempt helps for new learners like me who are novices to the programming world.
