#  Data Science

Welcome to my repository created as I learn skill sets needed for Data Science. 

I started as a complete beginner to the Python world and progressed towards learning Python the way which is supposed to be learnt (i.e is by making mistakes). Here in the repository I am creating Jupyter notebooks which I used to learn Python.

I started as a complete beginner to the Database World and progressed towards learning MySQL the way which is supposed to be learnt (i.e is by making mistakes). Here in the repository I am creating MySQL Workbench scripts which I used to learn MySQL

I would keep the mistake as it is in the file for the sake of understanding. Hope this attempt helps for new learners like me who are novices to the programming world.
